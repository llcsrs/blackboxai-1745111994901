# README Generator

## Project Overview
The **README Generator** is a Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extension designed to scan your project's classes and methods, automatically generating a well-structured README.md file based on the detected content. This tool helps streamline documentation processes, making it easier for developers to maintain project clarity and accessibility.

## Installation
To install the README Generator extension, follow these steps:

1. Install Visual Studio Code if you haven't already.
2. Open VSCode.
3. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
4. Search for "README Generator" or install it directly from the command line:
   ```bash
   code --install-extension your_username.readme-generator
   ```

## Usage
Once the extension is installed, you can generate a README file by following these steps:

1. Open a project directory in VSCode that contains classes and methods.
2. Press `F1` to open the Command Palette.
3. Type `Generate README from Classes and Methods` and select it.

The extension will scan the project and create a `README.md` file in the root of your project.

## Features
- Automatically generates a README file from your project's classes and methods.
- Simplifies the documentation process by extracting relevant information.
- Helps maintain a standardized format for README files.
